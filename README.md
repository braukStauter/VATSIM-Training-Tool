# VATSIM Training Tool
A simple training tracking website for VATSIM. This site allows for ARTCCs to manage students, and manage training records. Variable ARTCC access allows for data sharing and transparency across subdivisions. In addition, the site allows for easier and more modern record keeping.

## Changelog
The changelog will be available on this site, see the header keys for a list of updates.

## Documentation
The wiki will also be available on this site. It will go into a bunch of detail, but this is mostly so I don't forget why/how I did something specifically.

## Issues and Bugs
After v1.0, initial issue and bug tracking will be done here to keep everything organized. If you reach out to me directly, I'm going to send you there anyway so you might as well just go there yourself.
